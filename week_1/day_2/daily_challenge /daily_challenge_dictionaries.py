"""
Challenge: Create a dictionary that stores the indexes of each letter in a word.

Approach:
---------
1. Ask the user for input (a word).
2. Iterate over the word using `enumerate()` to get both the index and the letter.
3. For each letter:
   - Use the letter as a dictionary key (must be a string, which it already is).
   - Store all positions (indexes) of the letter inside a list.
   - If the letter is not yet in the dictionary, initialize it with an empty list.
   - Append the current index to the list.
4. Print the final dictionary.

This approach is efficient (O(n) time complexity), 
because each letter is processed only once, and appending to a list is constant time.
