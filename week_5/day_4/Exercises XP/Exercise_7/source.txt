Welcome to Exercise 7: Reading and Copying Files!

This is the source file that will be copied to destination.txt using the Node.js fs module.

Key concepts covered in this exercise:
- Reading files using fs.readFileSync()
- Writing files using fs.writeFileSync()
- Directory listing using fs.readdirSync()
- File operations error handling

The fs (File System) module is one of the core Node.js modules that provides an API for interacting with the file system. It allows you to:
- Read files and directories
- Write files
- Create and delete directories
- Get file information
- Watch files for changes

This exercise demonstrates basic file operations that are essential for many Node.js applications, such as:
- Configuration file processing
- Log file management
- Data file handling
- Backup operations

Happy coding with Node.js file operations!
