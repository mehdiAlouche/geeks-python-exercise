Welcome to the Node.js Daily Challenge!

This file demonstrates file operations in Node.js.
The fs (File System) module is a core module that allows us to work with the file system.

Key features of the fs module:
- Read files (sync and async)
- Write files
- Append to files
- Delete files
- Create directories
- And much more!

Node.js makes file operations simple and efficient.
Happy coding!
