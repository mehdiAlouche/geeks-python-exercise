-- Exercise 1 : Students table

-- 1. Create the database
CREATE DATABASE bootcamp;

-- 2. Create the students table
CREATE TABLE students (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    birth_date DATE
);

-- 3. Insert data into the students table
INSERT INTO students (first_name, last_name, birth_date) VALUES
('Marc', 'Benichou', '1998-11-02'),
('Yoan', 'Cohen', '2010-12-03'),
('Lea', 'Benichou', '1987-07-27'),
('Amelia', 'Dux', '1996-04-07'),
('David', 'Grez', '2003-06-14'),
('Omer', 'Simpson', '1980-10-03');

-- Insert my own info
INSERT INTO students (first_name, last_name, birth_date)
VALUES ('Mehdi', 'Idouallouche', '1999-11-10');

-- 4. Select queries

-- Fetch all of the data from the table
SELECT * FROM students;

-- Fetch all of the students first_names and last_names
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM students;

-- Fetch the student which id is equal to 2
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM students WHERE id = 2;

-- Fetch the student whose last_name is Benichou AND first_name is Marc
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM students
WHERE last_name = 'Benichou' AND first_name = 'Marc';

-- Fetch the students whose last_names are Benichou OR first_names are Marc
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM students
WHERE last_name = 'Benichou' OR first_name = 'Marc';

-- Fetch the students whose first_names contain the letter 'a'
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM students
WHERE first_name ILIKE '%a%';

-- Fetch the students whose first_names start with the letter 'a'
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM students
WHERE first_name ILIKE 'a%';

-- Fetch the students whose first_names end with the letter 'a'
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM students
WHERE first_name ILIKE '%a';

-- Fetch the students whose second to last letter of their first_names is 'a'
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM students
WHERE first_name ILIKE '%a_';

-- Fetch the students whose idâ€™s are equal to 1 AND 3
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM students
WHERE id IN (1, 3);

-- Fetch the students whose birth_dates are equal to or come after 2000-01-01
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE birth_date >= '2000-01-01';
